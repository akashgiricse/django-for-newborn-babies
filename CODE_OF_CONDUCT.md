### Guideline for Pull Request

- Always create a separate branch for any changes that you are working on. While 
creating a pull request, create a pull request from `your-branch` to `master` branch. **Do not directly push to master**
- Always squash your commits to a single commit before creating a PR.
- You commit message should be self explanatory.
